# Not For Tourists #

Not For Tourists (NFT) http://www.notfortourists.com is launching their very first iPhone app. First stop is Manhattan, where NFT will put the most exciting island on the planet in the comfort of your own pocket. With beautiful custom maps and thousands of essential listings, NFT will help you accomplish the any task in just a few seconds including: caffeinate, buy paint at 3 am, fix your bike, mail a late birthday card, chill out in a community garden, buy arugula from the nearest farmers market, or find a hotel by the hour (seriously, it’s that comprehensive).

And it’s incredibly fast. Unlike most travel apps, NFT doesn’t need to be online to work its magic. Whether you’re on the subway at rush hour or in the middle of Central Park on a lazy Sunday, NFT will be there for you.

It’s like having a best friend in every neighborhood. Sneak preview: http://www.nftiphone.com

Designed and developed by: http://www.tuftandco.com

# PrimoSpot NYC Parking #

Find The Right Place To Park!

PrimoSpot uses route me to find on-street and garages in the NYC area.  We are using cloudmade tiles.  We have our own custom delegates for reloading markers from our server as the user moves the map.  Also we have implemented the 'mini map' idea from a certain native maps app on the phone.

# SnapMyLife #

SnapMyLife is a place where you can share your day in photos, keep up with friends and family, or just see someone's life on the other side of the world.

SnapMyLife consists of several components. The main one being the SnapMyLife website. The site is accessible from both desktop and mobile phone browsers. There is also a special version of the site for Safari on the iPhone.

Because the iPhone is such a rich platform, we decided to create a native iPhone application using the route-me open source project that makes accessing the site easier. What follows is a description of some of the views of the SnapMyLife iPhone application.

The first two screen shots show the list view and the view used to upload an image taken with the camera. As long as the user allows it, the application will use the LocationManager to GeoTag images.

By GeoTaging the location an image was taken, the site can reverse GeoTag the image to provide a human readable location. See the detail view below.

All of this allows us to have a map view with pins showing images taken in the displayed area. The view across the top is a scrollable view of thumbnails corresponding to pins in the map view. If a user touches a pin, a semi-transparent detail view will appear with more information about the image.

# Historic Earth #

Drawing on the archives of Historic Map Works, the world's largest online collection of geo-coded historic maps, Historic Earth allows you to virtually travel back through time in many U.S. cities and states. Geo-coding allows the maps to closely overlay a modern map, so that the same locations can be compared in various time periods.

Launching with 32,000 high-resolution maps covering several cities and states (including NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Maine, and most of the Midwest) the collection will be expanding to 130,000 soon after launch as more of the Historic Map Works archive is made available.
